    "The new, more streamlined code, simplifies the loop simulation because it gets rid of the need to create a list for the doors and then shuffle it. This is done by using the random.randint() function in place of the doors = [] that creates a list and then random.shuffle(doors). However, although this simplifies the code, I find that the original code ChatGPT had created was easier to understand. This is becuase making a list and then shuffling the doors clearly explains the begining steps of the Monte Hall problem. On the other hand, random.randint() combines the two and especially since I do not have much prior coding knwoledge, if I were to see this new code before the original I think I would have had a hard time understanding what was happening.

    "Here’s a summary of our exchanges for your homework assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "Monty Hall Problem Simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Monty Hall problem involves a contestant choosing between three doors: one has a car, the other two have goats. After the contestant chooses, the host opens a door with a goat and gives the contestant the option to switch doors. The problem asks whether switching or staying increases the chances of winning the car.\n",
    "Initial Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "We started with a simulation of the Monty Hall problem in Python, where the game is repeated for a number of trials (e.g., 10,000). The contestant’s choice is randomly determined, and the host opens a door. The simulation tracks the number of wins if the contestant switches doors versus staying with their original choice.\n",
    "Key Steps in the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomly assign the car behind one of the doors.\n",
    "Contestant makes an initial random choice.\n",
    "The host opens a door that does not have the car or the contestant's choice.\n",
    "Determine if switching or staying leads to a win.\n",
    "Results are printed showing the win percentage for both strategies.\n",
    "Streamlined Version:\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the simulation, we used fewer variables and list comprehensions to eliminate unnecessary steps. This version is easier to explain and understand while still accurately simulating the Monty Hall problem.\n",
    "Key improvements included:\n",
    "Using random.randint() for door selection.\n",
    "Reducing list creation to determine which door the host opens and which door the contestant could switch to.\n",
    "Streamlining win condition checks for switching and staying.\n",
    "Expected Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "In both versions of the simulation, switching wins approximately 66% (2/3) of the time, while staying wins around 33% (1/3) of the time, supporting the idea that switching doors is the better strategy.\n",
    "This summary covers the problem description, the initial and streamlined versions of the code, and the expected results from running the simulation. Let me know if you need any more details!\n",

    "## Question 5, Summary of interaction for part 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a summary of our exchanges regarding the development and discussion of the Markovian chatbot:\n",
    "\n",
    "Markovian Chatbot Initial Code\n",
    "You shared the basic structure of a Markovian chatbot that uses a dictionary to store word frequencies (word_used) and the probabilities of the next word following each word (next_word). The goal was to model a chatbot based on word transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "I suggested an improvement using Python's defaultdict from the collections module to simplify the initialization of word frequency counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extended Code with Two-Word Sequences\n",
    "You shared an extension of the code where you started associating each word with characters from the avatar.character column (from a dataset) and tracking two-word sequences (word + words[i+1]) instead of just single words.\n",
    "\n",
    "This extension allowed for a more detailed model by tracking two-word sequences per character and predicting the next word based on those sequences. The structure made use of nested dictionaries to store word pairs and their following words.\n",
    "\n",
    "I explained that this approach increases the word dependency and makes it a second-order Markov model, as it predicts the next word based on two previous words (a two-word sequence).\n",
    "\n",
    "Discussion on Higher-Order Markov Models\n",
    "You asked what it's called when you increase the word dependency. I explained that increasing the word dependency is referred to as increasing the order of the Markov model. For example, a first-order Markov model depends on one previous word, while a second-order Markov model depends on two previous words.\n",
    "Bigrams vs. Second-Order Markov Models\n",
    "You asked if the extension you provided is an example of a bigram model. I clarified that while your model uses bigrams (two-word sequences), it is not a pure bigram model. Instead, it is part of a second-order Markov model, as it predicts the next word based on two previous words (a bigram). A pure bigram model only predicts the next word based on one previous word.\n",
    "This summary captures the key concepts discussed regarding your chatbot, including the use of bigrams, second-order Markov models, and the improvement of the chatbot's word prediction capabilities. Let me know if you'd like any modifications before submitting it!\n",

    "Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Chatbot was able to generate explanations for the different steps of the Monte Hall/Markovian chatbot code pretty quickly. However, sometimes, the answers were unfocused such as when I gave Markovian chatbot extension #2 code right away after the original code. In addition, when I tried to direct chatgpt by giving it the word bigram, it actually gave me a different answer than when I fed chat both extensions #1 and #2. Before, it had directly related that extension #2 used bigrams, but, now it says that the code is an example of a second order markov model. When I asked chatgpt if a second order markov model is the same thing as a bigram, it had said no. However, when I asked a TA during office hours the same question, he had said yes. Thus, I think chatgpt had given me false information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It wasn't unhelpful because as needed, chatgpt would break down each step in the monte hall problem or markovian chatbot code further so that I could understand it. Moreover, on some concepts that I hadn't heard about such as second order markovian models, I could ask chatgpt to expand on it. However, I did find it a bit frustrating that when I continously ask chatgpt to break something down further because I do not understand it, chatgpt would give me more or less the same answer but in different words. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. I think chatgpt is useful in providing instantaneous information on theories and applications of code. However, its explanations are often times lengthy and sometimes a bit redundant. Thus, you need to locate the part of chatgpt's response that is relevant to what you want to know. When it comes to troubleshooting code, chatgpt was able to easily locate the origin of the errors and also provide direct answers on alternative codes you can use to fix it. Moreover, chatgpt gives you very personalized answers and explanations that fits your immediate needs, which is especially more practical compared to google searches where you have to visit numerous websites to find the answer you need. Google searches are also unable to give you recommended coding solutions to errors you run into. All in all I think chatgpt is able to give you the baseline coding information you need in a more beginner freiendly way."

    "Question 7\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems that chatgpt percieves itself as a highly personalizable and adaptive tool in aiding people to understand statiscal/coding information. For example, if I come across a topic in the course textbook or elsewhere online which I do not understand, I can ask chatgpt to summarize it for me or break it down into a simpler example. However, sometimes chatgpt seems as if it refuses to admit that it does not know something, even going to great lengths as to make up information. For example, in the first homework assignment and tutorial, chatgpt would give non existant data in such a confident way that if you did not take the time to actually run the cvs file in juptyer hub, you would think that it was a real cvs link that worked. Moreover, since chatgpt isn't an actual conscious being that responds to you but rather as we learned in Lecture 2, the product of the evolution of numerous chatbots - the most simple being based on the theory of markovian chains - its answers follow a certain pattern. Thus, inevitably, when you still do not understand a concept and ask chatgpt to explain it to you further, it found that it simply repeats itself but just with different words. But despite this, my perception of AI learning tools before starting this couse compared to my current perception has changed. Before, I had heavy skepticism against AI chatbots as it did not seem like you would actually \"learn\" anything but simply regurgitate whatever chatgpt would answer. However, I have found chatgpt extremely practical (much more so than using google search) as it is able to give me specific reponses to my queries while taking in the fact that I am a beginner in coding. When I use google search, almost all the websites I visit consist of code accomponied by long paragraphs using coding terminology that I had never heard of, as if assuming that I already have a foundational knowledge of python. But, it also became clear to me during these first few weeks of the course of the importance of at least engaging with chatgpt with some idea of what you are looking for so that you can give chatgpt concise prompts - otherwise known as prompt generating - to obtain the answers you need."

    "Part 4\n",
    "Through my concersation with chatgpt, I came to realize different career paths involving the manipulation of induced pluripotent stem cells whether that be in research, pharmaceuticals, or clincial application development. Moreover, I learned of the importance of having at least some knowledge of data analysis, statistics, and coding languags (especially R and python) in scientific fields as it often involves having to gather samples and analyze data for reliability and validity. Chatgpt mentioned that this is especially becuase the use of technology (computer science skills) is no longer limited to only software devlopment but is being increasingly integrated into other career fields where employers expect applicants to be able to handle coding independently. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 5\n",
    "In my opinion, chatgpt gives rather detailed information, which I found very helful in understanding the role of coding and data analysis in the field of statistics as well as other fields (which I had originally thought were completely unrelated) such as biology. Moreover, I think chatgpt helps to devlop/maintain an open mind about different areas of study/career becuase it does not give yes or no answers. Instead, it seems to always account for instances to disprove each point even if they might be rare occurences. I do not think that I could expect the same level of impartiallity in the responses of a real human as they are likely to be more biased based on their own preferences and personal experiences. However, when it came to asking chatgpt to differentiate between two similar fields of study, its explaantions did not did not really help in outlining each of their characterisitcs to draw a clear line. Thus, while chatgpt gave me a guidline of the different skillsets needed and career fields available, if I want the detailed information I am looking for, I need to seek out someone who is highly specialized in the area. For example, this could come in the form of professors that teach courses in certain majors or professors who conduct research on topics related to my interests."
