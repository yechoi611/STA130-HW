    "\n",
    "A simple linear regression only illustrates the relationship between the outcome and one predictor while a multiple linear regression takes into account multiple predictors. The multiple linear regression is more benefitial because it has better prediction accuracy and can account for confounding variables. For example, in a multiple linear regression you can isolate particular predictors to investigate the effect of a specific predictor. \n",
    "\n",
    "A continous variable is one that can take on any value. An example is age. However, an indicator varaible is categorical and binary, meaning it can take on the value of either 0 or 1. The linear form of a contious variable looks like outcome = B0 + BA(predictorA). The linear form of a indicator variable looks like outcome = B0 + BA1(predictorA).\n",
    "\n",
    "The model can capture the overall trend of the continous variable as well as a categorical shift from the indicator variable. The linear form is: outcome = B0 + BA(predictorA) + BB1(predictorB).\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding an interaction term between a continuous variable and an indicator variable in a Multiple Linear Regression model allows you to obtain a slope of the regression line for the continous variable within each indicator variable group. The linear form is: outcome = B0 + BA(predictorA) + BB1(predictorB) + BC(predictorA*1(predictorB)).\n",
    "\n",
    "When a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model uses only indicator variables derived from a non-binary categorical variable, it models the effect of each category on the outcome as a separate shift or difference from a chosen \"baseline\" category. This approach provides a way to quantify how each category's mean outcome differs relative to this baseline, allowing the model to capture categorical distinctions without implying any continuous trend among categories. The linear form is: B0+B11(predictor1)+B21(predictor2)+B(k-1)1(predictork-1). To represent a categorical variable with k levels, we create k-1 binary indicator variables, each representing one of the categories except the chosen baseline."

To make predictons in the without interaction model, you can plug in values for the TV and online spending indicatos. In the with interaction model, include the product of the two indicators (which will be 1 only if both budgets are high). This model predicts that sales may benefit differently depending on whether both ad budgets are high together, allowing for combined effects."

    "The contradiction arises becuase R squared value, coefficiants, and p values all measure different aspects of a relationship between predictors and the outcomes. R squared measures the overall explanatory power of a linear regression model. In other words, an r squares of 17.6% would tell you that the model can only explain for a small portion of the variability you see in the outcomes. Thus, other predictors need to be taken into account to build a better model. On the other hand, coefficiants tell you whether the predictor is indeed affecting the outcome with a coefficiant of 0 indicating no relationship. Then, their corresponding p values let you evaluate if you should reject or fail to reject your null hypothesis. You null hypothesis will usually be: there is no relationship, hence the coefficiant is 0. To summarize, the contradiction arises becuase a r squared value refers to the cumulative model fit while the coefficiants and the p values explain relationships between specific predictors and the outcome."

    "\n",
    "Here’s a summary of our discussions regarding model complexity, multicollinearity, and generalizability in multiple linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Model Complexity and Overfitting\n",
    "We analyzed multiple linear regression models (Model 3 and Model 4) using a Pokémon dataset, focusing on how model complexity impacts generalizability. Model 3, with a simpler linear form (HP ~ Attack + Defense), yielded consistent in-sample and out-of-sample R-squared values, indicating that it generalized well to the test data. In contrast, Model 4, a much more complex model involving several interaction terms, showed a significant drop in out-of-sample R-squared, suggesting it overfit the training data. This overfitting occurred because Model 4’s complexity allowed it to capture incidental, non-generalizable patterns (i.e., noise) specific to the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multicollinearity and the Design Matrix\n",
    "We discussed how Model 4’s complexity contributed to multicollinearity—a situation where predictor variables in the model are highly correlated, making it difficult to discern their individual contributions to the outcome variable. In Model 4’s linear form, numerous interactions were included, creating additional predictor variables in the design matrix (model4_spec.exog) used to fit the model. This excessive complexity led to multicollinearity, confirmed by a high condition number (an indicator of multicollinearity) in the model summary output. When predictors are multicollinear, the model’s ability to generalize is weakened because it becomes too sensitive to small changes or noise in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Centering and Scaling to Address Multicollinearity\n",
    "To examine and reduce multicollinearity, we applied centering and scaling to continuous predictor variables in Model 3 and Model 4, which reduced the condition number for Model 3 significantly. However, even with centering and scaling, Model 4’s condition number remained very high, indicating persistent multicollinearity. This reinforced that the high complexity of Model 4’s design matrix, driven by multiple interaction terms, limited the model's generalizability due to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Understanding Training Data Noise\n",
    "We clarified that training data noise consists of random, incidental patterns that don’t represent real relationships in the data population. Complex models, like Model 4, are more prone to overfitting because they capture these noisy patterns specific to the training data, leading to poor performance on test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Takeaway\n",
    "Through these models, we explored how simpler models with fewer predictors can better capture generalizable relationships, whereas overly complex models may overfit and fail to generalize. Overfitting and multicollinearity, when unchecked, lead to poor out-of-sample performance, emphasizing the importance of model parsimony, multicollinearity diagnostics, and evaluating in-sample versus out-of-sample R-squared values to assess generalizability.\n",

It also acounts for categorical varaibles: generation, type 1, and type 2. With these additions, the in sample fit of the model is increased to capture more nuanced relationships. \n",
    "\n",
    "Model 6 is extended and developed from model 5 by being more simpler. This is done by only using the predictors that were identified to be significant from model 5. As a result, you can avoid overfitting. Thus, you can get a model that doesn't have feature redundancy and a high in sample and out of sample r squared value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model 7 is extended and developed from model 6 by including interactions between predictors. So you are able to see how these predictors combined could influence the outcome. By centering and scaling model 7, multicollinearity is also addressed since this minimzes the effects of predictor scaling differences.\n",

    "The puporse of this demonstration is to illustrate the model's performance for in sample and out of sample data. If it does not perform well for out of sample data, it means that overfitting has occurred. But, if the model performs poorly for both in and out sample data, it means that underfitting has occurred. The results of my demonstration can be interpreted by looking at the distribution of points around the y=x line. If the points fall close to the line, it means the model has balanced performance for both in sample and out of sample data. In the plot shown above, there seems to be a gap between in sample and out of sample r squared values signifying that overfitting has occurred. "

    "The codes provided in the homework question evaluates the predictive performance of models 6 and 7. In other words, it sees if these models are generalizable to different pokemon generations. It does this by comparing in and out of sample r squared values to see if the model is over/underfitting. If the in sample data has a high r squared value but the out of sample data has a low r squared value, you can deduce that the model is overfitting. On the other hand, if both r squared values in the subsets of data are similar, you can deduce that the model generalizes well. Here, we see that model 7 is more complex since it takes into account more predictors and interactions. This would result in better performance with the in sample data. However, it would be overfitting for the out of sample data since the model is more likely to capture noise. Compared to this, model 6 is simpler and thus generalizes well for all data subsets. This means that model 6 is more reliable in real world application. All in all, the provided illustrations show how you need to be able to consider tradeoffs between model complexity and model generalizability when building your regression models."

    "You initially asked about comparing two regression models (Model 6 and Model 7) and their generalizability across different Pokémon generations.\n",
    "I explained that comparing in-sample and out-of-sample R-squared values helps assess whether a model is overfitting or generalizing well. A high in-sample R-squared and low out-of-sample R-squared indicates overfitting, while similar R-squared values across subsets indicate good generalization.\n",
    "Discussion of Model Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed why Model 7 is considered more complex: it includes more predictors and interactions, which results in better in-sample performance. However, this complexity can lead to overfitting, making the model less reliable for out-of-sample predictions.\n",
    "In contrast, Model 6 is simpler, with fewer predictors and interactions, and generalizes better across different datasets, making it more reliable in real-world applications.\n",
